Class for high-level control of the DARwIn-OP using the action editor/motion manager.

Created by Alyssa Batula

This code belongs in a subfolder of /darwin/Linux/project/MotionController on the DARwIn-OP. To compile, run 'make' (or 'sudo make') in the MotionController folder.

Running this code will probably require sudo privileges. If running still fails, try executing from the parent directory (project).
