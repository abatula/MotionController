MotionController
================

Class for high-level control of the DARwIn-OP using the action editor/motion manager.

This code belongs in a subfolder of /darwin/Linux/project/MotionController on the DARwIn-OP. The file motion_1024.bin belongs in the /darwin/Data folder. To compile, run 'make' in the MotionController folder.

Any code that runs this may need to be executed from the parent directory (project). It also will probably require sudo privileges.
